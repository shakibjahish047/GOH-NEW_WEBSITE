<b class="policy-list"> Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Prevention Policies of Gate of Hope<br></b>
<b class="policy-list">1. Introduction<br></b>
Gender-Based Violence (GBV) represents a grave violation of human rights and a pervasive global issue, impacting millions of individuals irrespective of their gender, age, socioeconomic status, or cultural background. The term GBV encompasses a wide range of harmful behaviors directed at an individual based on their gender. These behaviors can be physical, sexual, psychological, or economic in nature, and they often stem from deep-rooted gender inequalities, power imbalances, and societal norms that perpetuate discrimination and violence.<br>

The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that approximately one in three women worldwide experiences physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, predominantly by an intimate partner. However, GBV is not confined to women alone; men, non-binary individuals, and members of the LGBTQ+ community can also be victims. The consequences of GBV are far-reaching, affecting not only the immediate victims but also their families, communities, and workplaces. It leads to severe physical and mental health issues, loss of productivity, and significant economic costs.<br>

For organizations like Gate of Hope, which operates in challenging environments such as Afghanistan, addressing GBV is particularly crucial. The societal and cultural contexts in these regions often exacerbate the prevalence and severity of GBV, making it imperative for organizations to take a proactive stance. Gate of Hope, dedicated to assisting the forgotten people of Afghanistan through sectors like health, agriculture, education, and social affairs, recognizes that creating a safe and supportive work environment is foundational to achieving its mission.<br>

<b class="policy-list">1.1 Background<br></b>

Gender-Based Violence (GBV) is a pervasive and serious issue that affects individuals and communities worldwide.

GBV not only affects the immediate victims but also has broader social, economic, and health implications.<br>

At Gate of Hope, we recognize the profound impact GBV has on individuals and the broader community. As an organization committed to assisting the people of Afghanistan and fostering a safe and supportive environment, it is imperative that we address GBV with urgency and diligence.
